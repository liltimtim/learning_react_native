# Learning React Project

## How to Use
There will be several branches that will act as `folders`. 

The structure should be, if you are doing a tutorial for example you would create a branch called `tutorial/[tutorial_name]`.  

> You should only commit to your own tutorial branch with the specific feature / tutorial you are working on.  `Master` branch **should never** contain specific tutorial code.  The point of this is that if you wish to lookup a specific tutorial or topic, simply browse the branches instead of having to wade through a huge readme or huge code base.
